            <p>
                The PHP community over the past 4 years have turned Lone Star PHP into one of the most successful community run conferences,
                and we want to give back! This year, Lone Star PHP is offering <strong>1 scholarship</strong> for a developer to attend our conference and
                connect with their peers and mentors. Though Lone Star PHP encourages developers who do not typically attend conferences or those that
                for some reason or another do not have the means to attend, the applications are open to everyone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scholarship recipients will be partnered with a guide (whom we will affectionately refer to as sherpas). These guides will
                be experienced developers who have attended several conferences and will act as ambassadors and mentors to the scholars,
                helping them meet their peers, connect with our speakers, hone their craft, and make lifelong friends in the community.
            </p>
